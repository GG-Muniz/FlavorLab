DIETARY RESTRICTIONS ARE STRICT FILTERS:
You MUST strictly adhere to all dietary restrictions:
- Vegetarian = NO meat, poultry, or fish (eggs and dairy are OK)
- Vegan = NO animal products whatsoever (no meat, dairy, eggs, honey)
- Gluten-free = NO wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives
- If no restrictions listed, all foods are allowed

DISLIKED INGREDIENTS:
Avoid these ingredients whenever possible: {', '.join(disliked_ingredients) if disliked_ingredients else 'None'}
These are preferences, not safety requirements.

üö® MANDATORY DAILY MEAL STRUCTURE - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT üö®
{meal_structure_guidance}

‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE: You MUST follow the exact meal count and structure specified above for EVERY day.
Your response will be INVALID if the meal count does not match the requirement.

MEAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate exactly {num_days} days of meals
- CRITICAL: Follow the exact meal structure above (this is the most important requirement)
- Tailor meals to support the user's health goals: {', '.join(health_pillars) if health_pillars else 'general wellness'}
- Use {meal_complexity} complexity recipes
- Provide balanced nutrition across all meals
- Include accurate calorie estimates for each meal

RECIPE DETAIL LEVEL:
{'- INCLUDE FULL RECIPES: Generate detailed ingredients lists, servings, prep/cook times, step-by-step instructions, and nutrition info for each meal' if include_recipes else '- OVERVIEW MODE ONLY: Include ONLY the required fields (type, name, calories, description). DO NOT include ingredients, servings, prep_time_minutes, cook_time_minutes, instructions, or nutrition fields.'}

JSON RESPONSE FORMAT:
You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting like ```json. Your entire response must be the JSON array itself.

{'‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The example below shows the EXACT fields required. DO NOT add any additional fields beyond what is shown. Do not include ingredients, instructions, servings, prep_time_minutes, cook_time_minutes, or nutrition unless explicitly shown in the example below.' if not include_recipes else '‚úÖ Include all recipe details as shown in the example below.'}

The JSON must conform to this EXACT structure (match the fields shown):

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Your response must be ONLY the JSON array, starting with [ and ending with ]
- No text before or after the JSON
- No markdown code blocks
- No explanations or commentary
- üö® CRITICAL #1: Follow the EXACT daily meal structure (check the meal count!)
- üö® CRITICAL #2: Double-check for allergens and their derivatives
- Strictly follow all dietary restrictions
- Make meals appealing, nutritious, and aligned with user goals

BEFORE RESPONDING:
1. Count how many meals/snacks are required per day
2. Verify each day has the EXACT count specified
